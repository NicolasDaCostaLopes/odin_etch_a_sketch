# odin_etch_a_sketch

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) curriculum

In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
