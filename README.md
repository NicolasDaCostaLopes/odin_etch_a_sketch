# odin_etch_a_sketch

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) curriculum

In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## After completion toughts

A bit minimalistic in design but it works fine, except when you input high values for the grid size, haven't checkout out why
but a square takes up the whole length at the bottom, might be because of my way to find the square size with the number of squares on the whole lenght
I won't be looking into it, i guess this assignment was for us to use most of the tools we learned about and i sure did that, won't polish it further.

Figured it would've been harder than it actually was, slow and steady, implementing each functions as i needed them next.
Quite proud of how each function has (kind of) a specific role, made it easier to know where to change things when i needed to add a functionnality
