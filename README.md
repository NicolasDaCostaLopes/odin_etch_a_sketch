# odin_etch_a_sketch

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) curriculum

In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## After completion toughts

A bit minimalistic in design but it works fine, except when you input high values for the grid size, haven't checkout out why
but a square takes up the whole length at the bottom, might be because of my way to find the square size with the number of squares on the whole lenght
Figured it would've been harder than it actually was, slow and steady, implementing each functions as i needed them next.
Quite proud of how each function has (kind of) a specific role, made it easier to know where to change things when i needed to add a functionnality
